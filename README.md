# Microservices communication using RabbitMQ

## Description:

Build an inventory management system. The inventory management system aims to efficiently manage inventory
items, track stock levels, and handle orders through a microservices architecture. The system will utilize RabbitMQ
for inter-service communication and Docker for containerisation, ensuring scalability, modularity, and ease of
deployment
